# Comprehensive-E-Commerce-Data-Analysis-with-Python-and-SQL

### Project Overview
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of e-commerce data using Python and SQL to extract actionable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and overall business performance. By leveraging powerful Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib alongside SQL, I efficiently processed large datasets, performed sophisticated queries, and visualized key metrics to inform strategic decisions.

### Key Achievements
* Data Integration: Seamlessly combined Python and SQL to analyze datasets related to customers, geolocation, order items, orders, products, sellers, and payments.
* Top Cities Analysis: Identified the top 5 cities with the highest sales using advanced SQL queries and data manipulation in Python.
* Category Sales: Calculated total sales per product category through a combination of SQL and pandas, revealing high-performing segments.
* Order Trends: Analyzed monthly order trends for the year 2018 using SQL, providing insights into seasonal sales fluctuations.
* Customer Insights: Determined the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city, through data aggregation in Python and SQL.
* Revenue Contribution: Calculated the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category, combining SQL queries with pandas operations.
* Data Visualization: Created visualizations of total revenue and order volume by year for each category using matplotlib, highlighting long-term trends.
